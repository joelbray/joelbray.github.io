**My story:** As the wealthiest country on Earth, we have a moral obligation to ensure that 
everyone has access to the basic necessities of a dignified life: quality health care, safe housing, 
affordable education, and healthy food. With COVID-19 wreaking havoc on the most vulnerable 
people in our society, this responsibility has only grown. In the midst of this crisis, I decided 
to transition into progressive data and political tech. To achieve progressive goals, we need political 
power in the hands of people. We need a mass mobilization of people and communities in concert 
with school board and city council members, mayors, legislators, governors, and a president 
who will fight for economic, racial, and climate justice.
