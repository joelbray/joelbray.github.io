<p><h1>About me</h1></p>

___

I am the Managing Measurement & Analytics Strategist at [Authentic](https://authentic.org/).
Formerly, I was the Arizona Data Director at Mi Familia Vota. I also recently completed a 
PhD in Anthropology at Arizona State University, where I studied friendship among wild chimpanzees. 
In my spare time, I volunteer as the Data Team Lead for the [Emergency Workplace Organizing Committee](https://workerorganizing.org/), helping
non-unionized workers organize their workplaces.

Otherwise, I like to read science fiction, listen to Broadway musicals, and explore the 
outdoors with my family, including my 12 lb poodle mix, Buffy, who out-hikes us all.
