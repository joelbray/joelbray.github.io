<p><h1>About me</h1></p>

___

I am the Arizona Data Director at Mi Familia Vota, a Latinx civic engagement organization. 
I am also about to complete a PhD in Anthropology at Arizona State University, where I have 
studied friendship among wild chimpanzees.

In my spare time, I volunteer as a Data Team Lead for the [Emergency Workplace Organizing Committee](https://workerorganizing.org/), helping
non-unionized workers organize their workplaces. I also volunteer as a Policy Organizer for the [Democracy Policy Network](https://democracypolicy.network/), 
where I am currently packaging bold health care policy for state legislators.

Otherwise, I like to read science fiction, listen to Broadway musicals, and explore the 
outdoors with my family, including my 12 lb poodle mix, Buffy, who out-hikes us all.
