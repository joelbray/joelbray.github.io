I"1<p><h1>About me</h1></p>

<hr />

<p>I am a Data Scientist and PhD Researcher at Arizona State University.</p>

<p>I am about to complete my PhD in Anthropology, for which I have studied adult male friendships in wild chimpanzees at Gombe National Park, Tanzania.</p>

<p>As the wealthiest country on Earth, we have a moral obligation to ensure that everyone has 
access to the basic necessities of a dignified life: quality health care, safe housing, 
affordable education, and healthy food. With the COVID-19 wreaking havoc on the most vulnerable 
people in our society, this responsibility has only grown. At the same time, the pandemic has 
upended elections and political organizing, with campaigns and organizations moving into a 
digital- and data-intensive space. At this intersection of challenges, I am transitioning 
into progressive data and political tech. To achieve progressive goals, we need political power. 
We need a mass mobilization of people in concert with legislators, governors, and a president 
who will fight for economic and racial justice.</p>
